Create a playbook in /home/tom/ansible called report.yml and you need to copy a file test.txt as shown below to all the remote hosts at /root/abc.txt and then edit the lines in the file to provide the real information of the hosts.

Note: If a disk does not exist then write NONE.

test.txt
HOST=Inventory Hostname
MEMORY=Total Memory MB
BIOS= Bios Version
VDA_DISK_SIZE=disk size
VDB_DISK_SIZE=disk size
